# TIF
Template Interchange Format (TIF) is an XML format for the definition, exchange and comparison of administrative artifacts defined in 
PTC Integrity Lifecycle Manager. 
Administrative artifacts include 
•	Item types with their respective workflows, etc.
•	Field definitions
•	Trigger definitions
•	Query definitions
The goal of TIF is to capture, in a declarative form, all the artifacts that make up an Integrity Lifecycle Manager template.
TIF is defined by an XML Schema: TIF.xsd. 
TIF’s form (XML, declarative, schema defined) allows it to be subject to a variety of transformations for a variety of purposes: 
•	automatic generation of documentation, 
•	generation of scripts, 
•	etc. 
These transformations are supported by the TIF workbench allowing a template defined by TIF to be deployed into an 
Integrity Lifecycle Manager server.
